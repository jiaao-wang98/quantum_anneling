Implemented Algorithms
======================

The algorithms currently implemented in the package can be *clustered* in three broad groups


Spectral clustering
-------------------

These algorithms involve finding the top (lowest or highest) eigenvectors of a specific matrix. Depending on the matrix used, one can distinguish several algorithms. Some well known matrices which can be used for signed networks are:

* Adjacency
* Signed Laplacian matrix


Semidefinite clustering
-----------------------

These algorithms involve the solution of a semidefinite programming optimisation problem.


Generalised eigenproblem clustering
-----------------------------------

These algorithms involve the finding the top (lowest or highest) eigenvectors of a pair of matrices.
